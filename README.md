Summarizer
==========

General Task:
One such task is the process of profile summarization, wherein specific details of a (generally reknowned) person or entity can be extracted from the texts in natural langage. My project deals with a similar problem with the involvement of templates to direct the structure of the information to be extracted from the text.

Inspiration:
The inspiration to pursue this project was to replicate the services provided by major online search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo!, wherein a summary of the person, company, movie or other entities is displayed when a search is performed. This eliminates the need for the user to dig into web pages unless more granular details are required.

Project Task:
The aim of the project was to extract information regarding the following five fields for each individual queried using the system.
	- Name
	- Date of Birth
	- Place of Birth
	- Father's Name
	- Mother's Name

This was my final project for the class CS6961: Information Extraction from Text. Run the code as:
python summarizer.py <Person_Name>
For example,
python summarizer.py Ronald Reagan
